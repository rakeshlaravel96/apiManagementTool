        <p>
            The Perfex API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. <br>
            The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.<br>
            A token is bound to a whole Perfex installation. To get started using the API you first need an API token, after activating our module.

                <p>
                    As long as you download our API module from CodeCanyon, extract its contens.<br>
                    You will notice a folder called "documentation" and a new zip file, called "upload.zip".<br>
                    Since "documentation" folder contains files that are not needed in your Perfex CRM's installation, we will focus on the "upload.zip" file.<br>
                    File upload.zip contains the module files (in a module format) that you upload in Perfex CRM's Modules installation section.

            Available commands of the API are described below, along with their request-response examples.<br>
            We strongly suggest that you hire a professional, in order to have your third party connection done, if you are not familiar with APIs, as we cannot guide you through the basic understanding of REST APIs (that is a requirement in order to use this item and falls completely outside the scope of our support plan terms of it).

        <h4>
            Custom fields

        <p>
            All commands support custom fields, starting from version 1.0.2 of the module. </p>
            <p>
                Please take a look at the Custom Fields section in order to ensure the correct implementation of each request that includes custom fields</p>
